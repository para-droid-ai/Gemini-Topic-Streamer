# Gemini Topic Streamer: Product Roadmap

## Vision

To establish Gemini Topic Streamer as a premier tool for individuals and teams seeking to deeply understand and continuously track evolving topics, transforming information overload into structured, actionable knowledge that can be consumed in multiple ways.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Experience (Current - Q3 2024)

**Goal:** Solidify the core functionality, enhance user experience, ensure robust data management, and refine the initial Text-to-Speech (TTS) implementation.

*   **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   **Enhanced Visual Feedback:** Improve loading states, empty states, and transitions for a smoother experience.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation & Accessibility:** Conduct an initial review and implement improvements for better keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance, including for TTS controls.
    *   **Streamlined Modals:** Optimize the "Add/Edit Stream" modal for clarity and ease of use, possibly with guided steps for new users.
    *   **Improved Error Handling:** More user-friendly error messages and notifications (e.g., toasts for non-critical issues).
    *   **Refine TTS Controls:** Enhance the user interface for TTS playback, including clearer status indication for audio loading/playing, and ensure consistent behavior of playback controls (play/pause, seek, speed, stop).
*   **Core Feature Enhancements:**
    *   **Advanced Stream Configuration UI:** Make Top-K, Top-P, Seed, and Thinking Budget settings more intuitive within the Edit Stream modal.
    *   **Focus Prompt Assistance:**
        *   Provide examples or templates for effective focus prompts.
        *   Refine the "Optimize Focus" feature for better results.
    *   **Basic Client-Side Scheduling PoC:**
        *   Experiment with simple client-side timers for stream refresh reminders or "best-effort" auto-refresh (clearly communicating limitations).
*   **Data Management:**
    *   **Local Storage Quota Warnings:** Alert users if they are approaching browser storage limits.
    *   **Selective Data Pruning:** Allow users to delete older updates from a stream to manage storage.
*   **Technical Debt & Testing:**
    *   **Unit Testing:** Implement unit tests for critical utility functions (e.g., export, API service calls, audio utilities).
    *   **Code Documentation:** Improve inline comments and ensure component props are well-documented.

## Phase 2: Power User Features & Customization (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025)

**Goal:** Empower users with more control, better organization, deeper analytical capabilities, and advanced TTS options.

*   **Advanced Stream Control:**
    *   **Negative Prompts:** Allow users to specify topics or keywords to exclude from updates.
    *   **Source Prioritization/Filtering (Concept):** Explore ways for users to indicate preferred types of sources or reliability levels (research-heavy).
    *   **Update Comparison (Basic):** Highlight differences or new sections in an update compared to the previous one.
*   **Organization & Management:**
    *   **Stream Tagging/Categorization:** Allow users to tag or group streams into folders for better organization, especially with many streams.
    *   **Bulk Actions:** Enable selecting multiple streams/updates for actions like deletion, export, or settings changes.
*   **Content Interaction & TTS:**
    *   **Improved Markdown Export:** Ensure exported Markdown is highly compatible with other editors and includes all relevant metadata.
    *   **Export to PDF (Client-Side):** Implement a "Print to PDF" or client-side PDF generation feature.
    *   **Annotation/Notes (Local):** Allow users to add personal notes to specific updates within the app (stored locally).
    *   **Advanced TTS Options:**
        *   Explore richer voice selection from a predefined list (if Gemini TTS API allows and is practical for client-side).
        *   Client-side caching of generated TTS audio (e.g., IndexedDB) for faster subsequent playback and reduced API calls.
        *   Persist user's preferred playback speed.
*   **Visualizations:**
    *   **Token Usage Stats:** Display estimated token usage per update and total for a stream.
    *   **Update Frequency Chart:** Basic visualization of when updates were fetched for a stream.
*   **Performance:**
    *   **Long List Optimization:** Implement virtualization for the stream update list and sidebar if performance degrades with many items.

## Phase 3: Collaboration & Ecosystem Integration (Q2 2025 - Q4 2025)

**Goal:** Expand beyond individual use, enabling sharing and integration with other tools. (This phase likely requires a backend component).

*   **Optional Cloud Sync & Backup:**
    *   User accounts for syncing streams, updates, and TTS preferences/cached audio across devices.
    *   Secure cloud backup and restore functionality.
*   **Sharing & Collaboration (Read-Only First):**
    *   Allow users to share a read-only link to a specific stream or update (potentially with a pre-rendered audio option).
    *   Explore concepts for collaborative stream building (multiple contributors).
*   **Expanded Export/Import:**
    *   Integration with note-taking apps (e.g., export to Obsidian, Logseq, Notion formats).
    *   OPML export for stream lists.
*   **Community Features (Conceptual):**
    *   A way to share and discover effective focus prompt templates.
*   **API for Power Users (Conceptual):**
    *   Allow programmatic interaction with streams if a backend is established.

## Future Exploration (Beyond 2025)

**Goal:** Push the boundaries of intelligent information tracking.

*   **AI-Powered Insights:**
    *   Automatic sub-topic identification within streams.
    *   Trend analysis based on stream content over time.
    *   AI-generated summaries *of entire streams*.
*   **Multi-Modal Support (TTS is the first step):** If Gemini API expands significantly, explore support for summarizing or tracking topics involving images, videos, or other audio inputs.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** Allow third-party developers to extend functionality.
*   **Deeper Personalization:** AI that learns user preferences for content style, sources, and even TTS voice/style over time.

*This roadmap is a living document and will be updated based on user feedback, technological advancements, and project priorities.*
